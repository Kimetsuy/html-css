      <p> Louie is a very energetic and happy kid with a strong sense of judgetment, though she is quite innocent and naive. Helps ANYONE she thinks that need help without a thought. Average cook, her food is edible. REALLY LIKES TO DRAW despite not having much time to do it. Doesn't know a thing before her 9's, just remembers the beach and the waves crashing at the shoreline. Actually has a "grandma" that took care of her for a 2 years before Louie decided she wanted to explore the world. Won't ever shut up about anything. Knows various animal facts, survival skills and also knows how to repais some things, though Alex is better in that matter.<p>
       <BR>
       <p>Has a well-kept hair for someone who is continuously travelling(like Snufkin), it's curly and a very dark brown. Isn't the smallest kid, avarege for her age. Quite soft voice, a bit high.
